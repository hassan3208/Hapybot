![Project Interface](https://github.com/TheHsnX/HappyBot/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-02-23%20201103.png)  


## 🚀 Introduction
HappyBot RAG is an AI-powered chatbot that utilizes **DeepSeek LLM** to perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Users can **upload documents** or **paste URLs**, and the chatbot retrieves relevant information to generate intelligent responses. There is an additional feature that user can also set LLM's temperature.

## 🔥 Features
- 📄 **Document Upload** - Users can upload PDFs, text files, or other documents.
- 🌐 **URL Processing** - Extracts and processes content from web pages.
- 🧠 **DeepSeek LLM** - Utilizes the powerful DeepSeek 1.5 model for natural language understanding.
- 🔍 **RAG-based Querying** - Enhances responses by fetching relevant content before generating answers.
- ⚡ **Fast & Efficient** - Optimized processing for quick responses.
